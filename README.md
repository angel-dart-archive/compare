[![The Angel Framework](https://angel-dart.github.io/images/logo.png)](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki)

**The purpose of this repository is to prove that
[Angel](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki) is objectively better
than all of the other existing Dart server-side frameworks.**

Yes, this is controversial. Yes, this is largely self-aggrandizing. And yes, I
am well aware that publishing may turn the framework space from friendly
acknowledgement into full-on competition. However, it is 100% necessary, both to
ensure that Angel draws in users, and to also introduce developers to server-side
Dart by providing them the best option for their purposes.

*So, what is Angel, if it's **so** good?*

Angel is a project I started over a year ago to bring a solid foundation
on which Dart applications could be built, end-to-end. At the time I entered
the Dart world, and to this very day, I have never seen another framework
which provides a complete development environment for modern, *full-stack*
applications built entirely with Dart. Angel wants to change that - forever.'

# Compared Frameworks
* [Angel](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki)
* [Aqueduct](https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct)
* [Jaguar](https://github.com/Jaguar-dart/jaguar)
* [Redstone](https://github.com/redstone-dart/redstone)
* [shelf](https://github.com/dart-lang/shelf)*

*NOTE**: `shelf` itself is not a "framework," per s√©, but people often use it
combined with packages like `shelf_route` or `shelf_rest` to build backends.

# Reporting Inaccuracy
If you feel that the contents of this repository as it concerns another
framework are inaccurate,
[file an issue](https://github.com/angel-dart/compare/issues),
and I will update this project accordingly.

each library is maintained.
